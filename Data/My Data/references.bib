	abstract = {Hydrogen (H) trapping by helium-vacancy (HeV) complexes in bulk and the near surface region of tungsten (W) have been investigated by molecular statics calculations that evaluate two different WH interatomic potentials, which use the same WHe, HeHe and HeH potentials. One of the WH potentials is a bond-order potential (BOP) developed by Juslin et al., while the other is an embedding atom method (EAM) potential developed by Wang et al.. Both potentials overestimate the H binding energies to He clusters in bulk W, as compared to DFT calculations, but properly predict the functional form of the H binding energies to He clusters with increasing number of He and H. The BOP simulations reveal that H binding energies to HexV complexes generally increase with increasing number of He. However, the EAM results indicate that the H binding energy as a function of number of He depends on the number of H, and the H binding energies change slightly at high He content. Compared with available DFT data, both BOP and EAM underestimate the H binding energies to HexV2Hm complexes. The BOP reproduces the He formation energy below a W surface, while the EAM potential better reproduces the H formation energy and the interactions between H and HeV complexes. Based on these comparisons, we determine that the EAM potential is more accurate than BOP for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of WHeH interactions. The EAM potential predicts that the difference in the average binding energies of H to stable HeV complexes near the W surface is less than 0.2 eV and the difference decreases with increasing He content. Thus, the EAM potential indicates that the effect of surfaces on H binding energies to large HeV complexes below the W surfaces can be ignored.},

    abstract = "{Understanding the interaction between hydrogen (H) and helium-vacancy (He-V) complexes in tungsten (W) is important for the development of plasma-facing materials in fusion reactors. H trapping by HexVy complexes in bulk W, as well as the H solution behavior and H trapping by HexV complexes near W(100), W(111), and W(110) surfaces, has been investigated by first-principles computer simulations using density function theory. The results show that the sequential H binding energies to HexV complexes in bulk W decrease with the increasing number of H and He. For the HexV2 complexes in bulk W, H prefers to trap at interstitial sites near the junction of the di-vacancy, where the H can minimize the isosurface of optimal charge density. The most stable interstitial sites for H below W surfaces are dependent on the surface orientation. Our calculations indicate that H atoms tend to prefer a depth of 0.3 nm below the W(100) and W(111) surfaces due to the surface reconstruction. The binding energy of H to a HeV complex near W surfaces has the most significant orientation dependence below the W(111) surface, followed by the W(100) and W(110) surfaces. Compared with the bulk value, the largest difference in the average binding energy of H to the stable HexV complexes at the three W surfaces is about 0.2 eV. Furthermore, the effect of surfaces on the H binding energy to HexV complexes can be ignored for depths greater than 0.65 nm.}",

abstract = {We have used density functional theory based ab initio calculations to investigate the tendency of He and H to form clusters. For both species the most stable interstitial configuration is in a tetrahedral site, however their clustering tendencies are totally different. The He–He interaction is purely elastic in nature and as such highly binding at close separation distances. The H–H interaction on the other hand is almost negligible since the elastic binding effect is compensated for by the change in effective position of the H states in the density of states. He atoms always bond more strongly to HexHy complexes in a vacancy than H atoms.}

@article{Wang2017,
	abstract = {An embedded-atom method potential has been developed for modeling hydrogen in body-centered-cubic (bcc) tungsten by fitting to an extensive database of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Comprehensive evaluations of the new potential are conducted by comparing various hydrogen properties with DFT calculations and available experimental data, as well as all the other tungsten--hydrogen potentials. The new potential accurately reproduces the point defect properties of hydrogen, the interaction among hydrogen atoms, the interplay between hydrogen and a monovacancy, and the thermal diffusion of hydrogen in tungsten. The successful validation of the new potential confirms its good reliability and transferability, which enables large-scale atomistic simulations of tungsten--hydrogen system. The new potential is afterward employed to investigate the interplay between hydrogen and other defects, including [1 1 1] self-interstitial atoms (SIAs) and vacancy clusters in tungsten. It is found that both the [1 1 1] SIAs and the vacancy clusters exhibit considerable attraction for hydrogen. Hydrogen solution and diffusion in strained tungsten are also studied using the present potential, which demonstrates that tensile (compressive) stress facilitates (impedes) hydrogen solution, and isotropic tensile (compressive) stress impedes (facilitates) hydrogen diffusion while anisotropic tensile (compressive) stress facilitates (impedes) hydrogen diffusion.},

abstract = {Properties of point defects resulting from the incorporation of inert-gas atoms in bcc tungsten are investigated systematically using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The most stable configuration for the interstitial neon, argon, krypton and xenon atoms is the tetrahedral site, similarly to what was found earlier for helium in W. The calculated formation energies for single inert-gas atoms at interstitial sites as well as at substitutional sites are much larger for Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe than for He. While the variation of the energy of insertion of inert-gas defects into interstitial configurations can be explained by a strong effect of their large atomic size, the trend exhibited by their substitutional energies is more likely related to the covalent interaction between the noble gas impurity atoms and the tungsten atoms. There is a remarkable variation exhibited by the energy of interaction between inert-gas impurities and vacancies, where a pronounced size effect is observed when going from He to Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe. The origin of this trend is explained by electronic structure calculations showing that p-orbitals play an important part in the formation of chemical bonds between a vacancy and an atom of any of the four inert-gas elements in comparison with helium, where the latter contains only 1s2 electrons in the outer shell. The binding energies of a helium atom trapped by five different defects (He-v, Ne-v, Ar-v, Kr-v, Xe-v, where v denotes a vacancy in bcc-W) are all in excellent agreement with experimental data derived from thermal desorption spectroscopy. Attachment of He clusters to inert gas impurity atom traps in tungsten is analysed as a function of the number of successive trapping helium atoms. Variation of the Young modulus due to inert-gas impurities is analysed on the basis of data derived from DFT calculations.}

An observed lattice expansion of a fraction of a per cent gives rise to an order of magnitude larger reduction in the surface acoustic wave velocity. A multiscale model, combining elasticity and density functional theory, is applied to the interpretation of observations. The measured lattice swelling is consistent with the relaxation volume of self-interstitial and helium-filled vacancy defects that dominate the helium-implanted material microstructure. Larger scale atomistic simulations using an empirical potential confirm the findings of the elasticity and density functional theory model for swelling. The reduction of surface acoustic wave velocity predicted by density functional theory calculations agrees remarkably well with experimental observations.}
